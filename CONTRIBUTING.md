# Contributing to Squid

Thanks for considering a contribution. Squid stays small and opinionated on purpose — the contract layer is markdown only — so most contributions land as a single `.md` edit and ship the next time someone runs `/plugin update`.

## What we're looking for

- **New `/scaffold` specs** — Rust, Java, mobile (Swift/Kotlin), additional Python/TS frameworks. Highest leverage.
- **Stub fill-ins** — 12 of the 19 specs under `skills/scaffold/specs/` are still placeholders. Fleshing one out is a great first PR.
- **Agent prompt improvements** — sharpening PM, SWE, Tester, PR Reviewer, or On-Call so they fail less often.
- **Bug reports** with a concrete repro (which skill, what input, what went wrong).
- **Doc clarifications** in `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or this file.

## What we're NOT looking for

- File templates, Jinja, render steps. Squid intentionally has none — specs replaced templates two pivots ago and we're not going back.
- Language-specific build tooling *for the plugin itself* (no `pyproject.toml`, no `Makefile`, no test suite at the repo root). The contract layer stays pure markdown.
- Large architectural changes without prior discussion — open an issue first.

## Quick start

1. Fork and clone the repo.
2. Load your working tree into Claude Code:
   ```
   claude --plugin-dir /path/to/your/fork
   ```
   This is the only path that exercises uncommitted changes (the marketplace install always pulls from GitHub).
3. Validate the manifest:
   ```
   claude plugin validate
   ```
4. Run the affected skill against a scratch directory (see [Testing your change](#testing-your-change)).
5. Open a PR.

## What to edit

| Change | File(s) |
|---|---|
| Agent behavior | `agents/<name>.md` |
| Skill (top-level) | `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` |
| New `/scaffold` spec | `skills/scaffold/specs/<name>.md` + add rows to the **Index of specs** table and the **spec-selection** table (Step 2 of the flow) in `skills/scaffold/SKILL.md` |
| Agent-team lifecycle | `docs/PROCESS.md` |

See [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) for full editing conventions, spec-writing style, and publishing flow.

## Adding a new spec (most common contribution)

Specs are **opinions, not code**. They state the rules with rationale; canonical files only appear inline as fenced examples. Foundation specs follow a five-section shape:

1. `When to use`
2. `When NOT to use`
3. `Decision tree`
4. `Canonical principles`
5. Supporting content (inline or in co-located docs)

Cross-reference, don't duplicate — if your spec needs uv guidance, write *"see `uv-python.md`"* rather than copying its content. Stubs are fine: ship the foundations and leave the long tail terse until real usage forces detail.

## Testing your change

There is no automated test suite. Testing means running the affected skill against a real scratch target.

- **Spec changes** → run `/scaffold` in an empty dir and confirm the generated `CLAUDE.md` reflects your spec.
- **Agent changes** → run `/day` on a scaffolded project and confirm the agent behaves as expected.
- **Pipeline changes** → run `/night` end-to-end with a small feature spec.
- **All changes** → `claude plugin validate` must pass.

## Submitting

- **Small fixes** (typos, doc clarifications, one-spec edits): open a PR directly.
- **Larger changes** (new agent, lifecycle changes, new pipeline, multi-spec refactor): open an issue first to align on scope.
- **One concern per PR.** Don't bundle a new spec with an agent rewrite — splitting them makes review tractable and reverts surgical.
- Don't bump the `version` in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` in your PR — maintainers handle versioning at release time.

## Reporting bugs

Open an issue with:

- Which command or skill you ran (e.g. `/night`, `/scaffold`, `software-engineer` agent).
- The exact input you gave.
- What happened vs. what you expected.
- Claude Code version (`claude --version`).
- Squid plugin version (visible in `/plugin list`).

## Releasing (maintainers)

The single source of truth for the plugin version is `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`. Git tags `vX.Y.Z` must agree with it; CI (`.github/workflows/release-check.yml`) blocks any tag push where they disagree.

Use the release script:

```
scripts/release.sh patch          # 0.2.5 -> 0.2.6
scripts/release.sh minor          # 0.2.5 -> 0.3.0
scripts/release.sh major          # 0.2.5 -> 1.0.0
scripts/release.sh 0.3.0          # explicit version
scripts/release.sh patch --dry-run
scripts/release.sh patch --yes    # skip the push confirmation
```

What it does, in order: verifies you're on `main` with a clean tree synced to `origin/main`; checks the new tag doesn't already exist; rewrites `plugin.json` via a Python JSON round-trip (preserves key order, no `jq` dependency); commits as `chore: release vX.Y.Z`; creates an annotated tag; and prompts before pushing the commit and the tag to `origin`.

After release, smoke-test from a fresh Claude Code session:

```
/plugin marketplace update squid
/plugin update squid@squid
```

**Manual fallback.** If the script can't run, the equivalent steps are: bump `version` in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` by hand → `git commit -m "chore: release v0.X.Y"` → `git tag -a v0.X.Y -m "v0.X.Y"` → `git push origin main` → `git push origin v0.X.Y`. CI still verifies the tag matches `plugin.json`.

**How git tags work.** Tags are local until you push them — plain `git push` does not send tags; you need `git push origin vX.Y.Z` (or `--tags`). The shields.io version badge on `README.md` queries GitHub's API for the highest-versioned *pushed* tag on the public repo, so it can lag your local state by exactly one push.
