Claude Code writes code fast. It's worse at writing the code *your team* would actually ship — code that follows your conventions, has tests you trust, and survives review.

**Squid is a [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) plugin that turns a feature spec into a reviewed PR through a 5-agent pipeline — PA → SWE → Tester → PR Reviewer → On-Call — with exactly two human gates: plan approval and final merge.** No file templates, no render step: just markdown specs and agent contracts, and every file in your project gets written by an agent that reads them.

## How it works

Run `/plan <feature-spec>` then `/implement-night`, and Squid drives this end-to-end:

```
  feature spec
       │
       ▼   /plan
  ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │ grill → PA grooms Tasks Plan (+ADR) → HUMAN approves (1/2)     │
  │ → branch + worktree                                            │
  └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
       │   /implement-night  (runs end-to-end in the worktree)
       ▼
  ┌─────────────────┐    ┌──────────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
  │ /implement-task │──▶ │ /review              │──▶ │ /review-ci      │
  │ SWE ↔ Tester    │    │ push → PA accept →   │    │ On-Call drives  │
  │ commit each task│    │ PR-Reviewer          │    │ CI to green     │
  └─────────────────┘    └──────────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
                                                              │
                                                              ▼
                                                   HUMAN squash-merges (2/2)
```

Branch + worktree, grooming, the per-task implement/verify loop, push, diff review, and CI are all automated — you only show up for the two gates. For a quick single change, run `/implement-task <task>` (the same SWE ↔ Tester loop, no planning or review pipeline). Starting from an empty repo? Run `/scaffold` first — it interviews you about the stack and writes a tailored `AGENTS.md` plus a folder skeleton (no application source).

## Who this is for

- **Yes:** solo devs and small teams shipping Python backends, TypeScript frontends, or Go TUIs who want Claude Code to *consistently* hit your team's bar without re-explaining conventions every session.
- **Maybe not:** teams with an established in-house agent pipeline they don't want to displace, or stacks Squid doesn't cover yet (Rust, Java, mobile — [PRs welcome](#contributing)).

## Install

```
/plugin marketplace add iusztinpaul/squid
/plugin install squid@iusztinpaul
```

That's it. Open any repo in Claude Code; the agents and skills appear in `/agents` and `/help`. Run `/plugin marketplace update iusztinpaul` later to pull fresh changes.

Installing Squid also pulls in three plugins the agent team relies on, all from Anthropic's official `claude-plugins-official` marketplace — `context7` (live library docs via MCP), `code-review`, and `commit-commands`. That marketplace ships with Claude Code, so these resolve and enable on their own. (Requires Claude Code v2.1.143+ for auto-enable; v2.1.110+ for the dependency mechanism. If a dependency fails to resolve, run `/plugin marketplace update claude-plugins-official`.)

<details>
<summary><b>Per-project install</b> — auto-prompt for everyone who clones a specific repo</summary>

Commit this into the target repo's `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "iusztinpaul": {
      "source": {
        "source": "github",
        "repo": "iusztinpaul/squid"
      }
    }
  },
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "squid@iusztinpaul": true
  }
}
```

When a teammate (or future-you on a fresh machine) opens that repo and trusts the folder, Claude Code prompts them to add the marketplace and install in one step. `enabledPlugins` alone isn't enough — `extraKnownMarketplaces` is what tells Claude Code where `squid@iusztinpaul` resolves to.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Local plugin development</b> — test uncommitted changes to Squid itself</summary>

```
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/squid
```

Launches Claude Code with the plugin loaded for the session. No marketplace, no install, no cache. Re-run after edits. This is the only path that exercises your local working tree directly on Claude Code v2.1+.

> `/plugin marketplace add /path/to/squid` reads the local `marketplace.json` but the plugin's `source` points at GitHub — so the install still fetches from `iusztinpaul/squid`, not your working tree.

## Skills & commands

| Surface | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/scaffold` | Interactive bootstrap. Asks what you're building (backend / frontend / TUI / mix), reads the relevant specs, writes a tailored `AGENTS.md`, and lays down an empty folder skeleton. Run `/plan` next to start building. |
| `/plan <feature-spec>` | Plan a feature: grill the spec, PA grooms an approved Tasks Plan (+ optional ADR), create the branch + worktree. Start here. |
| `/implement-night <plan>` | End-to-end single-feature pipeline (the diagram above) — builds the approved plan to a validated PR. |
| `/implement-task` · `/review` · `/review-ci` | Granular pipeline stages, runnable standalone: build tasks · push + acceptance + diff review · CI validation. |
| `/refactor` · `/triage-issue` · `/architecture-review` | Standalone planning/intake helpers (not wired into the main pipeline). |
| `product-architect`, `software-engineer`, `tester`, `pr-reviewer`, `oncall-engineer` | Sub-agents invoked by the pipelines; also usable directly via the `Agent` tool. |
| `testing-python`, `grilling`, `self-improve` | Support skills the pipelines and agents lean on. |

The `/scaffold` spec library (under `skills/scaffold/specs/`) covers:

- **Python:** backend layout, uv, pyproject, ruff, FastAPI, FastMCP, CLI tools
- **TypeScript frontend:** package/tsconfig/vite conventions, React, Vue, Svelte, vanilla
- **Go TUI:** layout + Bubbletea / tview patterns
- **Infra:** Docker, docker-compose, GitHub Actions monorepo CI, OpenAPI contracts
- **Process:** monorepo layout, Makefile delegator, tracker workflow

Several specs are still stubs — the foundations are filled in (`python-backend`, `typescript-frontend`, `go-tui`, `uv-python`, `pyproject`, `makefile-delegator`, `monorepo-layout`); the rest are good first contributions.

## Contributing

Issues and PRs welcome — especially new specs (Rust, Java, mobile, additional Python/TS frameworks) and stub fill-ins. See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started, and [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) for the underlying plugin-dev conventions.

## Quick start

In an empty directory:

```
/scaffold
```

The skill asks what you want to build (components, frameworks, infra, license) and writes:

- `AGENTS.md` — project brief distilled from the relevant specs (plus a one-line `CLAUDE.md` that points to it)
- Skeleton `packages/<component>/` directories with placeholder Makefiles and component-level `AGENTS.md`s
- Root `Makefile`, `.env.example`, `.gitignore`
- Optional: `docker-compose.yml`, `.github/workflows/`, `tasks/`

It does **not** write application source. That's the next step:

```
/implement-task "Bootstrap packages/backend with a FastAPI /health endpoint and one unit test."
```

The SWE agent reads `AGENTS.md`, picks up the specs it references, writes real code + tests, hands off to the Tester, and commits the task once it passes.

## Philosophy

- **Specs over templates.** Opinions live as markdown the agent reads — no Jinja, no render step, no drift between a template and what the agent produces.
- **Progressive disclosure.** A session loads only the skills whose descriptions match the task; the spec library is gated behind `/scaffold` so it doesn't pollute every session's index.
- **One skill per concern.** Adding a new stack is one markdown file, not a new scaffolding engine.
- **`AGENTS.md` is the brief.** After `/scaffold`, the generated `AGENTS.md` is the single source of truth for how that project builds. Specs are referenced, not transcluded.
- **Agents are gates.** The PA catches scope drift and signs off from the user's perspective; the Tester catches false-confidence "tests pass" claims and runs an e2e adversarial pass; the PR Reviewer catches dead/duplicate/untested code, over-engineering, and hot-path regressions; On-Call catches CI breakage. No agent both writes code and decides whether it's correct.
