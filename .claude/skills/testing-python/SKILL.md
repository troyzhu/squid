# Writing Effective Python Tests

## Core Principles

Every test should be **atomic**, **self-contained**, and test **single functionality**. A test that tests multiple things is harder to debug and maintain.

## Test Structure

### Atomic unit tests

Each test should verify a single behavior. The test name should tell you what's broken when it fails. Multiple assertions are fine when they all verify the same behavior.

```python
# Good: Name tells you what's broken
def test_user_creation_sets_defaults():
    user = User(name="Alice")
    assert user.role == "member"
    assert user.id is not None
    assert user.created_at is not None

# Bad: If this fails, what behavior is broken?
def test_user():
    user = User(name="Alice")
    assert user.role == "member"
    user.promote()
    assert user.role == "admin"
    assert user.can_delete_others()
```

### Use parameterization for variations of the same concept

```python
import pytest

@pytest.mark.parametrize("input,expected", [
    ("hello", "HELLO"),
    ("World", "WORLD"),
    ("", ""),
    ("123", "123"),
])
def test_uppercase_conversion(input, expected):
    assert input.upper() == expected
```

### Use separate tests for different functionality

Don't parameterize unrelated behaviors. If the test logic differs, write separate tests.

## Project-Specific Rules

<!--
Fill in project-specific conventions here. Common examples to consider:

- Global asyncio mode (e.g. `asyncio_mode = "auto"` in pyproject.toml → no
  `@pytest.mark.asyncio` decorators needed).
- Preferred test transports / in-memory clients for the server framework
  (e.g. FastAPI `TestClient`, FastMCP in-memory client).
- Snapshot testing conventions (e.g. `inline-snapshot`, `syrupy`).
- Required markers (`@pytest.mark.integration`, `@pytest.mark.slow`).
- Forbidden patterns (local imports inside test bodies, real network calls,
  real DB connections in unit tests).

Delete this comment and replace the examples below with the real rules.
-->

### Imports at module level

Put ALL imports at the top of the file. Do not import inside test function bodies.

```python
# Correct
import pytest
from myapp.service import do_work

def test_something():
    assert do_work() is not None

# Wrong - no local imports
def test_something():
    from myapp.service import do_work  # Don't do this
    ...
```

### Async tests

If the project sets `asyncio_mode = "auto"` in `pyproject.toml`, write async tests without decorators:

```python
# Correct (when asyncio_mode = "auto")
async def test_async_operation():
    result = await some_async_function()
    assert result == expected
```

Otherwise, mark explicitly with `@pytest.mark.asyncio`.

### Inline snapshots for complex data

If the project uses `inline-snapshot`, use it for JSON schemas and complex structures:

```python
from inline_snapshot import snapshot

def test_schema_generation():
    schema = generate_schema(MyModel)
    assert schema == snapshot()  # Will auto-populate on first run
```

Commands:
- `pytest --inline-snapshot=create` - populate empty snapshots
- `pytest --inline-snapshot=fix` - update after intentional changes

## Fixtures

### Prefer function-scoped fixtures

```python
@pytest.fixture
def client():
    return Client()

def test_with_client(client):
    result = client.ping()
    assert result is not None
```

### Use `tmp_path` for file operations

```python
def test_file_writing(tmp_path):
    file = tmp_path / "test.txt"
    file.write_text("content")
    assert file.read_text() == "content"
```

## Mocking

### Mock at the boundary

Use `pytest-mock`'s `mocker` fixture (preferred) or `unittest.mock` patches.

```python
from unittest.mock import AsyncMock

async def test_external_api_call(mocker):
    mock = mocker.patch("mymodule.external_client.fetch", new_callable=AsyncMock)
    mock.return_value = {"data": "test"}
    result = await my_function()
    assert result == {"data": "test"}
```

### Don't mock what you own

Test your code with real implementations when possible. Mock external services (HTTP APIs, third-party SDKs), not your own internal classes.

### Don't write unit tests against infrastructure components

Orchestrators, model-serving runtimes, observability clients, and similar infrastructure should be exercised via **integration tests**, not unit tests with mocks of their internals.

## Test Naming

Use descriptive names that explain the scenario:

```python
# Good
def test_login_fails_with_invalid_password():
def test_user_can_update_own_profile():
def test_admin_can_delete_any_user():

# Bad
def test_login():
def test_update():
def test_delete():
```

## Error Testing

```python
import pytest

def test_raises_on_invalid_input():
    with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="must be positive"):
        calculate(-1)

async def test_async_raises():
    with pytest.raises(ConnectionError):
        await connect_to_invalid_host()
```

## Running Tests

```bash
uv run pytest -n auto              # Run all tests in parallel
uv run pytest -n auto -x           # Stop on first failure
uv run pytest path/to/test.py      # Run specific file
uv run pytest -k "test_name"       # Run tests matching pattern
uv run pytest -m "not integration" # Exclude integration tests
```

Prefer project Make targets when available: `make unit-tests`, `make integration-tests`, `make tests`.

## Checklist

Before submitting tests:
- [ ] Each test tests one thing
- [ ] Imports at module level
- [ ] Descriptive test names
- [ ] Async decorators consistent with project's asyncio mode
- [ ] Parameterization for variations of same behavior
- [ ] Separate tests for different behaviors
- [ ] No unit tests against infrastructure components (those go to integration tests)
- [ ] 0 warnings when running the test suite
