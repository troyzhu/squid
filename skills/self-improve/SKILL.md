description: Analyze developer corrections from the current coding session and persist lessons learned as rules in AGENTS.md files or memory. Use this skill at the end of a coding session, after the developer has reviewed and corrected your work, when the developer says "self-improve", "learn from this session", "what did you learn", "update your rules", "remember this for next time", or any time the developer wants to capture feedback from corrections they made. Also trigger when the developer explicitly asks you to reflect on mistakes or extract patterns from their edits.

# Self-Improvement from Developer Feedback

After a coding session where the developer reviewed and corrected your work, this skill extracts reusable rules from those corrections and persists them so future sessions benefit — even if context is lost.

Run this **before** wrapping up the session so improvements are saved while the full conversation is still in context.

## Step 1: Scan the Conversation for Corrections

Review the entire conversation history and identify every instance where the developer:

- **Rejected** your approach ("no, don't do it that way", "that's wrong")
- **Modified** your code or suggestion (edited files after you wrote them, rewrote your implementation)
- **Redirected** your strategy ("use X instead of Y", "we don't do it like that here")
- **Corrected** a misunderstanding ("that's not what I meant", "the requirement is actually...")
- **Expressed frustration** with a pattern ("stop doing X", "I told you already")
- **Confirmed a non-obvious choice** ("yes, exactly like that", "perfect, keep doing that") — these are just as important as corrections because they validate approaches that should be repeated

Collect each correction as a raw observation with:
- What you originally did or proposed
- What the developer changed it to or asked for instead
- Any reasoning the developer gave (the "why")

## Step 2: Extract Rules

For each correction (or group of related corrections), distill a concrete, actionable rule. Good rules are:

**Specific and actionable** — they tell future-you exactly what to do:
- "When writing fixtures for async ODM models, always use the real async client, never `mongomock`"
- "Run `make format-fix` before committing, not after"
- "For this project, prefer `httpx` over `requests` for all HTTP calls"

**Not vague platitudes** — these are useless:
- "Follow best practices"
- "Write clean code"
- "Be more careful"

**Grouped when related** — if the developer corrected the same underlying issue multiple times (e.g., kept adding type hints you forgot), that's one rule, not five.

**Skipping one-offs** — if a correction was purely about a specific bug or a unique situation that won't recur, don't create a rule for it. The fix is already in the code.

For confirmed/validated approaches, frame the rule positively: "Continue using X pattern when Y" with a note that this was validated by the developer.

## Step 3: Present Rules for Approval

Show the developer all extracted rules in a numbered list. For each rule, include:

1. **The rule** — the concrete instruction
2. **Why** — the developer's reasoning (or your best understanding of it)
3. **Evidence** — brief reference to when this came up in the session
4. **Where to persist** — your recommendation for where this rule should live:
   - `AGENTS.md` (project root) — project-wide conventions, architecture decisions, coding standards
   - `AGENTS.md` (local, in a subdirectory) — module-specific conventions
   - `feedback memory` — personal preferences about collaboration style
   - `project memory` — project context, goals, constraints, deadlines
5. **Conflicts** — any existing rules this might contradict (see Step 4)

Ask the developer to:
- Approve, edit, or reject each rule
- Confirm or change the persistence location
- Resolve any conflicts you flagged

Do NOT persist anything without explicit approval.

## Step 4: Check for Contradictions

Before presenting rules, scan for conflicts:

1. **Read all AGENTS.md files** in the project (root and any subdirectories)
2. **Read the memory index** at `~/.claude/projects/*/memory/MEMORY.md` and any referenced memory files that seem related
3. **Compare** each new rule against existing rules

If a new rule contradicts an existing one:
- Flag it clearly: "New rule X conflicts with existing rule Y in `AGENTS.md:line N`"
- Present both versions to the developer
- Ask which to keep, or whether to merge them

If a new rule duplicates an existing one:
- Skip it and note: "Already captured in `AGENTS.md:line N`"

## Step 5: Persist Approved Rules

For each approved rule, persist it to the agreed location:

### AGENTS.md updates
- Read the target AGENTS.md file first
- Find the most appropriate section for the rule (or suggest creating a new section if none fits)
- Add the rule concisely — AGENTS.md should stay scannable, not become a novel
- Use the existing formatting style of the file

### Memory updates
- Use the memory system's frontmatter format
- For feedback memories: lead with the rule, then `**Why:**` and `**How to apply:**`
- For project memories: lead with the fact/decision, then `**Why:**` and `**How to apply:**`
- Update MEMORY.md index if creating new memory files
- Update existing memory files if the new rule extends or refines an existing memory

### After persisting
- Show the developer exactly what was written and where
- If a AGENTS.md was modified, show the diff

## Step 6: Summary

End with a brief summary:
- How many rules were extracted
- How many were persisted (and where)
- How many were skipped or already existed
- Any conflicts that were resolved

## Important Principles

- **Persistence is the whole point.** The value of this skill is that lessons survive beyond the current session. If you extract rules but don't write them down, you've wasted the developer's time.
- **Specificity beats coverage.** Three specific, actionable rules are worth more than ten vague ones.
- **The developer has final say.** Never persist a rule the developer didn't approve. Never rewrite a rule they already approved into something different.
- **Validated approaches matter.** Don't only learn from mistakes — also capture what worked well, especially non-obvious approaches that the developer confirmed were correct.
- **Check before writing.** Always read existing AGENTS.md files and memories before adding to them. Duplication erodes trust in the system.
